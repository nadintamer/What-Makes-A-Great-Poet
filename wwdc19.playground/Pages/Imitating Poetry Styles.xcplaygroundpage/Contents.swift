 ## Imitating Poetry Styles
"Everybody has to start somewhere, and the best way to learn is from people who have mastered your desired skill."
 
 Mr. Whiskers just received this advice from his mom, Mrs. Tibbs, and decided that she was right. So, he's decided to try and imitate the styles of some famouts poets.
 
 He knows that once he's written many poems, he'll develop his own distinctive style as well. Maybe one day another young kitten will study his poetry in school! âœ¨
