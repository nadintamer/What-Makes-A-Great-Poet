 ## Conclusion
Thank you so much for joining Mr. Whiskers and myself on this poetry exploration! Maybe it's inspired you to write your own poetry as well. ðŸ˜‰
 
 How about our initial question: "What makes a great poet?"
 
 I think the best possible answer we could give is that there is no single answer. Whether it be Dickinson's dashes, Frost's perfect rhymes, Pound's nature imagery or Mr. Whiskers' not yet fully developed style, each poet has something that makes them uniquely great. ðŸŽ‰
 
 All art in this Playground was drawn by myself on [make8bitart.com](make8bitart.com). All poems are from [poemhunter.com](poemhunter.com).
