lofty farm\nThat everyone for miles could see\nHis lantern when he did his chores\nIn winter after half-past three.\nAnd many must have seen him make\nHis wild descent from there one night,\n'Cross lots, 'cross walls, 'cross everything,\nDescribing rings of lantern light.\nBetween the house and barn the gale\nGot him by something he had on\nAnd blew him out on the icy crust\nThat cased the world, and he was gone!\nWalls were all buried, trees were few:\nHe saw no stay unless he stove\nA hole in somewhere with his heel.\nBut though repeatedly he strove\nAnd stamped and said things to himself,\nAnd sometimes something seemed to yield,\nHe gained no foothold, but pursued\nHis journey down from field to field.\nSometimes he came with arms outspread\nLike wings, revolving in the scene\nUpon his longer axis, and\nWith no small dignity of mien.\nFaster or slower as he chanced,\nSitting or standing as he chose,\nAccording as he feared to risk\nHis neck, or thought to spare his clothes,\nHe never let the lantern drop.\nAnd some exclaimed who saw afar\nThe figures he described with it,\n\"I wonder what those signals are\nBrown makes at such an hour of night!\nHe's celebrating something strange.\nI wonder if he's sold his farm,\nOr been made Master of the Grange.\"\nHe reeled, he lurched, he bobbed, he checked;\nHe fell and made the lantern rattle\n(But saved the light from going out.)\nSo half-way down he fought the battle\nIncredulous of his own bad luck.\nAnd then becoming reconciled\nTo everything, he gave it up\nAnd came down like a coasting child.\n\"Well\u2014I\u2014be\u2014\" that was all he said,\nAs standing in the river road,\nHe looked back up the slippery slope\n(Two miles it was) to his abode.\nSometimes as an authority\nOn motor-cars, I'm asked if I\nShould say our stock was petered out,\nAnd this is my sincere reply:\nYankees are what they always were.\nDon't think Brown ever gave up hope\nOf getting home again because\nHe couldn't climb that slippery slope;\nOr even thought of standing there\nUntil the January thaw\nShould take the polish off the crust.\nHe bowed with grace to natural law,\nAnd then went round it on his feet,\nAfter the manner of our stock;\nNot much concerned for those to whom,\nAt that particular time o'clock,\nIt must have looked as if the course\nHe steered was really straight away\nFrom that which he was headed for\u2014\nNot much concerned for them, I say:\nNo more so than became a man\u2014\nAnd politician at odd seasons.\nI've kept Brown standing in the cold\nWhile I invested him with reasons;\nBut now he snapped his eyes three times;\nThen shook his lantern, saying, \"Ile's\n'Bout out!\" and took the long way home\nBy road, a matter of several

They ought to know\nThat as a witch I'd often milk a bat\nAnd that'd be enough to last for days.\nIt'd make my position stronger, I think,\nIf I was to consent to give some sign\nTo make it surer that I was a witch?\nIt wa'n't no sign, I s'pose, when Mallice Huse\nSaid that I took him out in his old age\nAnd rode all over everything on him\nUntil I'd had him worn to skin and bones,\nAnd if I'd left him hitched unblanketed\nIn front of one Town Hall, I'd left him hitched\nIn front of every one in Grafton County.\nSome cried shame on me not to blanket him,\nThe poor old man. It would have been all right\nIf some one hadn't said to gnaw the posts\nHe stood beside and leave his trade mark on them,\nSo they could recognize them. Not a post\nThat they could hear tell of was scarified.\nThey made him keep on gnawing till he whined.\nThen that same smarty someone said to look-\nHe'd bet Huse was a cribber and had gnawed\nThe crib he slept in- and as sure's you're born\nThey found he'd gnawed the four posts of his bed,\nAll four of them to splinters. What did that prove?\nNot that he hadn't gnawed the hitching posts\nHe said he had besides. Because a horse\nGnaws in the stable ain't no proof to me\nHe don't gnaw trees and posts and fences too.\nBut everybody took it for proof.\nI was a strapping girl of twenty then.\nThe smarty someone who spoiled everything\nWas Arthur Amy. You know who he was.\nThat was the way he started courting me.\nHe never said much after we were married,\nBut I mistrusted he was none too proud\nOf having interfered in the Huse business.\nI guess he found he got more out of me\nBy having me a witch. Or something happened\nTo turn him round. He got to saying things\nTo undo what he'd done and make it right,\nLike, 'No, she ain't come back from kiting yet.\nLast night was one of her nights out. She's kiting.\nShe thinks when the wind makes a night of it\nShe might as well herself.' But he liked best\nTo let on he was plagued to death with me:\nIf anyone had seen me coming home\nOver the ridgepole, 'stride of a broomstick,\nAs often as he had in the tail of the night,\nHe guessed they'd know what he had to put up with.\nWell, I showed Arthur Amy signs enough\nOff from the house as far as we could keep\nAnd from barn smells you can't wash out of ploughed ground\nWith all the rain and snow of seven years;\nAnd I don't mean just skulls of Roger's Rangers\nOn Moosilauke, but woman signs to man,\nOnly bewitched so I would last him longer.\nUp where the trees grow short, the mosses tall,\nI made him gather me wet snow berries\nOn slippery rocks beside a waterfall.\nI made him do it for me in the dark.\nAnd he liked everything I made him do.\nI hope if he is where he sees me now\nHe's so far off he can't see what I've come to.\nYou _can_ come down from everything to nothing.\nAll is, if I'd a-known when I was young\nAnd full of it, that this would be the end,\nIt doesn't seem as if I'd had the courage\nTo make so free and kick up in folks' faces.\nI might have, but it doesn't seem as if."},{"author":"Robert Frost","title":"I Will Sing You One-O","content":"It

Frost","title":"The Generations of Men","content":"A governor it was proclaimed this time,\nWhen all who would come seeking in New Hampshire\nAncestral memories might come together.\nAnd those of the name Stark gathered in Bow,\nA rock-strewn town where farming has fallen off,\nAnd sprout-lands flourish where the axe has gone.\nSomeone had literally run to earth\nIn an old cellar hole in a by-road\nThe origin of all the family there.\nThence they were sprung, so numerous a tribe\nThat now not all the houses left in town\nMade shift to shelter them without the help\nOf here and there a tent in grove and orchard.\nThey were at Bow, but that was not enough:\nNothing would do but they must fix a day\nTo stand together on the crater's verge\nThat turned them on the world, and try to fathom\nThe past and get some strangeness out of it.\nBut rain spoiled all. The day began uncertain,\nWith clouds low trailing and moments of rain that misted.\nThe young folk held some hope out to each other\nTill well toward noon when the storm settled down\nWith a swish in the grass. 'What if the others\nAre there,' they said. 'It isn't going to rain.'\nOnly one from a farm not far away\nStrolled thither, not expecting he would find\nAnyone else, but out of idleness.\nOne, and one other, yes, for there were two.\nThe second round the curving hillside road\nWas a girl; and she halted some way off\nTo reconnoitre, and then made up her mind\nAt least to pass by and see who he was,\nAnd perhaps hear some word about the weather.\nThis was some Stark she didn't know. He nodded.\n'No f\u00eate to-day,' he said.\n'It looks that way.'\nShe swept the heavens, turning on her heel.\n'I only idled down.'\n'I idled down.'\nProvision there had been for just such meeting\nOf stranger cousins, in a family tree\nDrawn on a sort of passport with the branch\nOf the one bearing it done in detail-\nSome zealous one's laborious device.\nShe made a sudden movement toward her bodice,\nAs one who clasps her heart. They laughed together.\n'Stark?' he inquired. 'No matter for the proof.'\n'Yes, Stark. And you?'\n'I'm Stark.' He drew his passport.\n'You know we might not be and still be cousins:\nThe town is full of Chases, Lowes, and Baileys,\nAll claiming some priority in Starkness.\nMy mother was a Lane, yet might have married\nAnyone upon earth and still her children\nWould have been Starks, and doubtless here to-day.'\n'You riddle with your genealogy\nLike a Viola. I don't follow you.'\n'I only mean my mother was a Stark\nSeveral times over, and by marrying father\nNo more than brought us back into the name.'\n'One ought not to be thrown into confusion\nBy a plain statement of relationship,\nBut I own what you say makes my head spin.\nYou take my card- you seem so good at such things-\nAnd see if you can reckon our cousinship.\nWhy not take seats here on the cellar wall\nAnd dangle feet among the raspberry vines?'\n'Under the shelter of the family tree.'\n'Just so- that ought to be enough protection.'\n'Not from the rain. I think it's going to rain.'\n'It's raining.'\n'No, it's misting; let's be fair.\nDoes the rain seem to you to cool the eyes?'\nThe situation was like this: the road\nBowed outward on the mountain half-way up,\nAnd disappeared and ended not far off.\nNo one went home that way. The only house\nBeyond where they were was a shattered seedpod.\nAnd below roared a brook hidden in trees,\nThe sound of which was silence for the place.\nThis he sat listening to till she gave judgment.\n'On father's side, it seems, we're- let me see- - '\n'Don't be too technical.- You have three cards.'\n'Four cards, one yours, three mine, one for each branch\nOf the Stark family I'm a member of.'\n'D'you know a person so related to herself\nIs supposed to be mad.'\n'I may be mad.'\n'You look so, sitting out here in the rain\nStudying genealogy with me\nYou never saw before. What will we come to\nWith all this pride of ancestry, we Yankees?\nI think we're all mad. Tell me why we're here\nDrawn into town about this cellar hole\nLike wild geese on a lake before a storm?\nWhat do we see in such a hole, I wonder.'\n'The Indians had a myth of Chicamoztoc,\nWhich means The Seven Caves that We Came out of.\nThis is the pit from which we Starks were digged.'\n'You must be learned. That's what you see in it?'\n'And what do you see?'\n'Yes, what do I see?\nFirst let me look. I see raspberry vines- - '\n'Oh, if you're going to use your eyes, just hear\nWhat I see. It's a little, little boy,\nAs pale and dim as a match flame in the sun;\nHe's groping in the cellar after jam,\nHe thinks it's dark and it's flooded with daylight.'\n'He's nothing. Listen. When I lean like this\nI can make out old Grandsir Stark distinctly,-\nWith his pipe in his mouth and his brown jug-\nBless you, it isn't Grandsir Stark, it's Granny,\nBut the pipe's there and smoking and the jug.\nShe's after cider, the old girl, she's thirsty;\nHere's hoping she gets her drink and gets out safely.'\n'Tell me about her. Does she look like me?'\n'She should, shouldn't she, you're so many times\nOver descended from her. I believe\nShe does look like you. Stay the way you are.\nThe nose is just the same, and so's the chin-\nMaking allowance, making due allowance.'\n'You poor, dear, great, great, great, great Granny!'\n'See that you get her greatness right. Don't stint her.'\n'Yes, it's important, though you think it isn't.\nI won't be teased. But see how wet I am.'\n'Yes, you must go; we can't stay here for ever.\nBut wait until I give you a hand up.\nA bead of silver water more or less\nStrung on your hair won't hurt your summer looks.\nI wanted to try something with the noise\nThat the brook raises in the empty valley.\nWe have seen visions- now consult the voices.\nSomething I must have learned riding in trains\nWhen I was young. I used the roar\nTo set the voices speaking out of it,\nSpeaking or singing, and the band-music playing.\nPerhaps you have the art of what I mean.\nI've never listened in among the sounds\nThat a brook makes in such a wild descent.\nIt ought to give a purer oracle.'\n'It's as you throw a picture on a screen:\nThe meaning of it all is out of you;\nThe voices give you what you wish to hear.'\n'Strangely, it's anything they wish to give.'\n'Then I don't know. It must be strange enough.\nI wonder if it's not your make-believe.\nWhat do you think you're like to hear to-day?'\n'From the sense of our having been together-\nBut why take time for what I'm like to hear?\nI'll tell you what the voices really say.\nYou will do very well right where you are\nA little longer. I mustn't feel too hurried,\nOr I can't give myself to hear the voices.'\n'Is this some trance you are withdrawing into?'\n'You must be very still; you mustn't talk.'\n'I'll hardly breathe.'\n'The voices seem to say- - '\n'I'm waiting.'\n'Don't! The voices seem to say:\nCall her Nausicaa, the unafraid\nOf an acquaintance made adventurously.'\n'I let you say that- on consideration.'\n'I don't see very well how you can help it.\nYou want the truth. I speak but by the voices.\nYou see they know I haven't had your name,\nThough what a name should matter between us- - '\n'I shall suspect- - '\n'Be good. The voices say:\nCall her Nausicaa, and take a timber\nThat you shall find lies in the cellar charred\nAmong the raspberries, and hew and shape it\nFor a door-sill or other corner piece\nIn a new cottage on the ancient spot.\nThe life is not yet all gone out of it.\nAnd come and make your summer dwelling here,\nAnd perhaps she will come, still unafraid,\nAnd sit before you in the open door\nWith flowers in her lap until they fade,\nBut not come in across the sacred sill- - '\n'I wonder where your oracle is tending.\nYou can see that there's something wrong with it,\nOr it would speak in dialect. Whose voice\nDoes it purport to speak in? Not old Grandsir's\nNor Granny's, surely. Call up one of them.\nThey have best right to be heard in this place.'\n'You seem so partial to our great-grandmother\n(Nine times removed. Correct me if I err.)\nYou will be likely to regard as sacred\nAnything she may say. But let me warn you,\nFolks in her day were given to plain speaking.\nYou think you'd best tempt her at such a time?'\n'It rests with us always to cut her off.'\n'Well then, it's Granny speaking: 'I dunnow!\nMebbe I'm wrong to take it as I do.\nThere ain't no names quite like the old ones though,\nNor never will be to my way of thinking.\nOne mustn't bear too hard on the new comers,\nBut there's a dite too many of them for comfort.\nI should feel easier if I could see\nMore of the salt wherewith they're to be salted.\nSon, you do as you're told! You take the timber-\nIt's as sound as the day when it was cut-\nAnd begin over- - ' There, she'd better stop.\nYou can see what is troubling Granny, though.\nBut don't you think we sometimes make too much\nOf the old stock? What counts is the ideals,\nAnd those will bear some keeping still about.'\n'I can see we are going to be good friends.'\n'I like your 'going to be.' You said just now\nIt's going to rain.'\n'I know, and it was raining.\nI let you say all that. But I must go now.'\n'You let me say it? on consideration?\nHow shall we say good-bye in such a case?'\n'How shall we?'\n'Will you leave the way to me?'\n'No, I don't trust your eyes. You've said enough.\nNow give me your hand up.- Pick me that flower.'\n'Where shall we meet again?'\n'Nowhere but here\nOnce more before we meet elsewhere.'\n'In rain?'\n'It ought to be in rain. Sometime in rain.\nIn rain to-morrow, shall we, if it rains?\nBut if we must, in sunshine.'

New Hampshire gold\u2014\nYou may have heard of it. I had a farm\nOffered me not long since up Berlin way\nWith a mine on it that was worked for gold;\nBut not gold in commercial quantities,\nJust enough gold to make the engagement rings\nAnd marriage rings of those who owned the farm.\nWhat gold more innocent could one have asked for?\nOne of my children ranging after rocks\nLately brought home from Andover or Canaan\nA specimen of beryl with a trace\nOf radium. I know with radium\nThe trace would have to be the merest trace\nTo be below the threshold of commercial;\nBut trust New Hampshire not to have enough\nOf radium or anything to sell.\nA specimen of everything, I said.\nShe has one witch\u2014old style. She lives in Colebrook.\n(The only other witch I ever met\nWas lately at a cut-glass dinner in Boston.\nThere were four candles and four people present.\nThe witch was young, and beautiful (new style),\nAnd open-minded. She was free to question\nHer gift for reading letters locked in boxes.\nWhy was it so much greater when the boxes\nWere metal than it was when they were wooden?\nIt made the world seem so mysterious.\nThe S'ciety for Psychical Research\nWas cognizant. Her husband was worth millions.\nI think he owned some shares in Harvard College.)\nNew Hampshire used to have at Salem\nA company we called the White Corpuscles,\nWhose duty was at any hour of night\nTo rush in sheets and fool's caps where they smelled\nA thing the least bit doubtfully perscented\nAnd give someone the Skipper Ireson's Ride.\nOne each of everything as in a showcase.\nMore than enough land for a specimen\nYou'll say she has, but there there enters in\nSomething else to protect her from herself.\nThere quality makes up for quantity.\nNot even New Hampshire farms are much for sale.\nThe farm I made my home on in the mountains\n1 had to take by force rather than buy.\nI caught the owner outdoors by himself\nRaking.up after winter, and I said,\n\"I'm going to put you off this farm: I want it.'\n\"Where are you going to put me? In the road?\"\n\"I'm going to put you on the farm next to it.\"\n\"Why won't the farm next to it do for you?'\n'I like this better.' It was really better.\nApples? New Hampshire has them, but unsprayed,\nWith no suspicion in stern end or blossom end\nOf vitriol or arsenate of lead,\nAnd so not good for anything but cider.\nHer unpruned grapes are flung like lariats\nFar up the birches out of reach of man.\nA state producing precious metals, stones,\nAnd\u2014writing; none of these except perhaps\nThe precious literature in quantity\nOr quality to worry the producer\nAbout disposing of it.

I thought they weren't.\nI thought they couldn't be. And yet they were.\nI'd sure had no such friends in Massachusetts\nAs Hall of Windham, Gay of Atkinson,\nBartlett of Raymond (now of Colorado),\nHarris of Derry, and Lynch of Bethlehem.\nThe glorious bards of Massachusetts seem\nTo want to make New Hampshire people over.\nThey taunt the lofty land with little men.\nI don't know what to say about the people.\nFor art's sake one could almost wish them worse\nRather than better. How are we to write\nThe Russian novel in America\nAs long as life goes so unterribly?\nThere is the pinch from which our only outcry\nIn literature to date is heard to come.\nWe get what little misery we can\nOut of not having cause for misery.\nIt makes the guild of novel writers sick\nTo be expected to be Dostoievskis\nOn nothing worse than too much luck and comfort.\nThis is not sorrow, though; it's just the vapors,\nAnd recognized as such in Russia itself\nUnder the new regime, and so forbidden.\nIf well it is with Russia, then feel free\nTo say so or be stood against the wall\nAnd shot. It's Pollyanna now or death.\nThis, then, is the new freedom we hear tell of;\nAnd very sensible. No state can build\nA literature that shall at once be sound\nAnd sad on a foundation of well-being.\nTo show the level of intelligence\nAmong us: it was just a Warren farmer\nWhose horse had pulled him short up in the road\nBy me, a stranger.

Darwin.'\n'Go 'long,' I said to him, he to his horse.\nI knew a man who failing as a farmer\nBurned down his farmhouse for the fire insurance,\nAnd spent the proceeds on a telescope\nTo satisfy a lifelong curiosity\nAbout our place among the infinities.\nAnd how was that for otherworldliness?\nIf I must choose which I would elevate \u2014\nThe people or the already lofty mountains\nI'd elevate the already lofty mountains\nThe only fault I find with old New Hampshire\nIs that her mountains aren't quite high enough.\nI was not always so; I've come to be so.\nHow, to my sorrow, how have I attained\nA height from which to look down critical\nOn mountains? What has given me assurance\nTo say what height becomes New Hampshire mountains,\nOr any mountains? Can it be some strength\nI feel, as of an earthquake in my back,\nTo heave them higher to the morning star?\nCan it be foreign travel in the Alps?\nOr having seen and credited a moment\nThe solid molding of vast peaks of cloud\nBehind the pitiful reality\nOf Lincoln, Lafayette, and Liberty?\nOr some such sense as says bow high shall jet\nThe fountain in proportion to the basin?\nNo, none of these has raised me to my throne\nOf intellectual dissatisfaction,\nBut the sad accident of having seen\nOur actual mountains given in a map\nOf early times as twice the height they are\u2014\nTen thousand feet instead of only five\u2014\nWhich shows how sad an accident may be.\nFive thousand is no longer high enough.\nWhereas I never had a good idea\nAbout improving people in the world,\nHere I am overfertile in suggestion,\nAnd cannot rest from planning day or night\nHow high I'd thrust the peaks in summer snow\nTo tap the upper sky and draw a flow\nOf frosty night air on the vale below\nDown from the stars to freeze the dew as starry.\nThe more the sensibilitist I am\nThe more I seem to want my mountains wild;\nThe way the wiry gang-boss liked the logjam.\nAfter he'd picked the lock and got it started,\nHe dodged a log that lifted like an arm\nAgainst the sky to break his back for him,\nThen came in dancing, skipping with his life\nAcross the roar and chaos, and the words\nWe saw him say along the zigzag journey\nWere doubtless as the words we heard him say\nOn coming nearer: 'Wasn't she an i-deal\nSon-of-a-bitch? You bet she was an i-deal.'\nFor all her mountains fall a little short,\nHer people not quite short enough for Art,\nShe's still New Hampshire; a most restful state.\nLately in converse with a New York alec\nAbout the new school of the pseudo-phallic,\nI found myself in a close corner where\nI bad to make an almost funny choice.\n'Choose you which you will be\u2014a prude, or puke,\nMewling and puking in the public arms.'\n'Me for the hills where I don't have to choose.\"\n'But if you bad to choose, which would you be?'\n1 wouldn't be a prude afraid of nature.\nI know a man who took a double ax\nAnd went alone against a grove of trees;\nBut his heart failing him, he dropped the ax\nAnd ran for shelter quoting Matthew Arnold:\n''Nature is cruel, man is sick of blood':\nThere s been enough shed without shedding mine.\nRemember Birnam Wood! The wood's in flux!'\nHe had a special terror of the flux\nThat showed itself in dendrophobia.\nThe only decent tree had been to mill\nAnd educated into boards, be said.\nHe knew too well for any earthly use\nThe line where man leaves off and nature starts.\nAnd never overstepped it save in dreams.\nHe stood on the safe side of the line talking\u2014\nWhich is sheer Matthew Arnoldism,\nThe cult of one who owned himself 'a foiled\nCircuitous wanderer,' and 'took dejectedly\nHis seat upon the intellectual throne'\u2014\nAgreed in 'frowning on these improvised\nAltars the woods are full of nowadays,\nAgain as in the days when Ahaz sinned\nBy worship under green trees in the open.\nScarcely a mile but that I come on one,\nA black-checked stone and stick of rain-washed charcoal.\nEven to say the groves were God's first temples\nComes too near to Ahaz' sin for safety.\nNothing not built with hands of course is sacred.\nBut here is not a question of what's sacred;\nRather of what to face or run away from.\nI'd hate to be a runaway from nature.\nAnd neither would I choose to be a puke\nWho cares not what be does in company,\nAnd when he can't do anything, falls back\nOn words, and tries his worst to make words speak\nLouder than actions, and sometimes achieves it.\nIt seems a narrow choice the age insists on\n8ow about being a good Greek, for instance)\nThat course, they tell me, isn't offered this year.\n'Come, but this isn't choosing\u2014puke or prude?'\nWell, if I have to choose one or the other,\nI choose to be a plain New Hampshire farmer\nWith an income in cash of, say, a thousand\n(From, say, a publisher in New York City).\nIt's restful to arrive at a decision,\nAnd restful just to think about New Hampshire.\nAt present I am living in Vermont."},{"author":"Robert Frost","title":"The Witch of Coos","content":"I staid the night for shelter at a farm\nBehind the mountains, with a mother and son,\nTwo old-believers.

And then someone\nBegan the stairs, two footsteps for each step,\nThe way a man with one leg and a crutch,\nOr a little child, comes up. It wasn't Toffile:\nIt wasn't anyone who could be there.\nThe bulkhead double-doors were double-locked\nAnd swollen tight and buried under snow.\nThe cellar windows were banked up with sawdust\nAnd swollen tight and buried under snow.\nIt was the bones. I knew them -  and good reason.\nMy first impulse was to get to the knob\nAnd hold the door. But the bones didn't try\nThe door; they halted helpless on the landing,\nWaiting for things to happen in their favour.'\nThe faintest restless rustling ran all through them.\nI never could have done the thing I did\nIf the wish hadn't been too strong in me\nTo see how they were mounted for this walk.\nI had a vision of them put together\nNot like a man, but like a chandelier.\nSo suddenly I flung the door wide on him.\nA moment he stood balancing with emotion,\nAnd all but lost himself. (A tongue of fire\nFlashed out and licked along his upper teeth.\nSmoke rolled inside the sockets of his eyes.)\nThen he came at me with one hand outstretched,\nThe way he did in life once; but this time\nI struck the hand off brittle on the floor,\nAnd fell back from him on the floor myself.\nThe finger-pieces slid in all directions.\n(Where did I see one of those pieces lately?\nHand me my button-box- it must be there.)\nI sat up on the floor and shouted, 'Toffile,\nIt's coming up to you.' It had its choice\nOf the door to the cellar or the hall.\nIt took the hall door for the novelty,\nAnd set off briskly for so slow a thing,\nStillgoing every which way in the joints, though,\nSo that it looked like lightning or a scribble,\n&gt;From the slap I had just now given its hand.\nI listened till it almost climbed the stairs\n&gt;From the hall to the only finished bedroom,\nBefore I got up to do anything;\nThen ran and shouted, 'Shut the bedroom door,\nToffile, for my sake!' 'Company?' he said,\n'Don't make me get up; I'm too warm in bed.'\nSo lying forward weakly on the handrail\nI pushed myself upstairs, and in the light\n(The kitchen had been dark) I had to own\nI could see nothing. 'Toffile, I don't see it.\nIt's with us in the room though. It's the bones.'\n'What bones?' 'The cellar bones- out of the grave.'\nThat made him throw his bare legs out of bed\nAnd sit up by me and take hold of me.\nI wanted to put out the light and see\nIf I could see it, or else mow the room,\nWith our arms at the level of our knees,\nAnd bring the chalk-pile down. 'I'll tell you what-\nIt's looking for another door to try.\nThe uncommonly deep snow has made him think\nOf his old song, The Wild Colonial Boy,\nHe always used to sing along the tote-road.\nHe's after an open door to get out-doors.\nLet's trap him with an open door up attic.'\nToffile agreed to that, and sure enough,\nAlmost the moment he was given an opening,\nThe steps began to climb the attic stairs.\nI heard them. Toffile didn't seem to hear them.\n'Quick !' I slammed to the door and held the knob.\n'Toffile, get nails.' I made him nail the door shut,\nAnd push the headboard of the bed against it.\nThen we asked was there anything\nUp attic that we'd ever want again.\nThe attic was less to us than the cellar.\nIf the bones liked the attic, let them have it.\nLet them stay in the attic. When they sometimes\nCome down the stairs at night and stand perplexed\nBehind the door and headboard of the bed,\nBrushing their chalky skull with chalky fingers,\nWith sounds like the dry rattling of a shutter,\nThat's what I sit up in the dark to say-\nTo no one any more since Toffile died.\n2o3 Let them stay in the attic since they went there.\nI promised Toffile to be cruel to them\nFor helping them be cruel once to him.\nSON: We think they had a grave down in the cellar.\nMOTHER: We know they had a grave down in the cellar.\nSON: We never could find out whose bones they were.\nMOTHER: Yes, we could too, son.

It wasn't true.\nThe opposite was true. The tree had me.\nThe minute it was left with me alone\nIt caught me up as if I were the fish\nAnd it the fishpole.

Let go!'\nBut I, with something of the baby grip\nAcquired ancestrally in just such trees\nWhen wilder mothers than our wildest now\nHung babies out on branches by the hands\nTo dry or wash or tan, I don't know which,\n(You'll have to ask an evolutionist)-\nI held on uncomplainingly for life.\nMy brother tried to make me laugh to help me.\n'What are you doing up there in those grapes?\nDon't be afraid. A few of them won't hurt you.\nI mean, they won't pick you if you don't them.'\nMuch danger of my picking anything!\nBy that time I was pretty well reduced\nTo a philosophy of hang-and-let-hang.\n'Now you know how it feels,' my brother said,\n'To be a bunch of fox-grapes, as they call them,\nThat when it thinks it has escaped the fox\nBy growing where it shouldn't-on a birch,\nWhere a fox wouldn't think to look for it-\nAnd if he looked and found it, couldn't reach it-\nJust then come you and I to gather it.\nOnly you have the advantage of the grapes\nIn one way: you have one more stem to cling by,\nAnd promise more resistance to the picker.'\nOne by one I lost off my hat and shoes,\nAnd still I clung. I let my head fall back,\nAnd shut my eyes against the sun, my ears\nAgainst my brother's nonsense; 'Drop,' he said,\n'I'll catch you in my arms. It isn't far.'\n(Stated in lengths of him it might not be.)\n'Drop or I'll shake the tree and shake you down.'\nGrim silence on my part as I sank lower,\nMy small wrists stretching till they showed the banjo strings.\n'Why, if she isn't serious about it!\nHold tight awhile till I think what to do.\nI'll bend the tree down and let you down by it.'\nI don't know much about the letting down;\nBut once I felt ground with my stocking feet\nAnd the world came revolving back to me,\nI know I looked long at my curled-up fingers,\nBefore I straightened them and brushed the bark off.\nMy brother said: 'Don't you weigh anything?\nTry to weigh something next time, so you won't\nBe run off with by birch trees into space.'\nIt wasn't my not weighing anything\nSo much as my not knowing anything-\nMy brother had been nearer right before.\nI had not taken the first step in knowledge;\nI had not learned to let go with the hands,\nAs still I have not learned to with the heart,\nAnd have no wish to with the heart-nor need,\nThat I can see.

Never mind,\nThings must expect to come in front of us\nA many times-I don't say just how many-\nThat varies with the things-before we see them.\nOne of the lies would make it out that nothing\nEver presents itself before us twice.\nWhere would we be at last if that were so?\nOur very life depends on everything's\nRecurring till we answer from within.\nThe thousandth time may prove the charm.- That leaf!\nIt can't turn either way. It needs the wind's help.\nBut the wind didn't move it if it moved.\nIt moved itself. The wind's at naught in here.\nIt couldn't stir so sensitively poised\nA thing as that. It couldn't reach the lamp\nTo get a puff of black smoke from the flame,\nOr blow a rumple in the collie's coat.\nYou make a little foursquare block of air,\nQuiet and light and warm, in spite of all\nThe illimitable dark and cold and storm,\nAnd by so doing give these three, lamp, dog,\nAnd book-leaf, that keep near you, their repose;\nThough for all anyone can tell, repose\nMay be the thing you haven't, yet you give it.\nSo false it is that what we haven't we can't give;\nSo false, that what we always say is true.\nI'll have to turn the leaf if no one else will.\nIt won't lie down. Then let it stand. Who cares?'\n'I shouldn't want to hurry you, Meserve,\nBut if you're going- Say you'll stay, you know?\nBut let me raise this curtain on a scene,\nAnd show you how it's piling up against you.\nYou see the snow-white through the white of frost?\nAsk Helen how far up the sash it's climbed\nSince last we read the gage.'\n'It looks as if\nSome pallid thing had squashed its features flat\nAnd its eyes shut with overeagerness\nTo see what people found so interesting\nIn one another, and had gone to sleep\nOf its own stupid lack of understanding,\nOr broken its white neck of mushroom stuff\nShort off, and died against the window-pane.'\n'Brother Meserve, take care, you'll scare yourself\nMore than you will us with such nightmare talk.\nIt's you it matters to, because it's you\nWho have to go out into it alone.'\n'Let him talk, Helen, and perhaps he'll stay.'\n'Before you drop the curtain-I'm reminded:\nYou recollect the boy who came out here\nTo breathe the air one winter-had a room\nDown at the Averys'? Well, one sunny morning\nAfter a downy storm, he passed our place\nAnd found me banking up the house with snow.\nAnd I was burrowing in deep for warmth,\nPiling it well above the window-sills.\nThe snow against the window caught his eye.\n'Hey, that's a pretty thought'-those were his words.\n'So you can think it's six feet deep outside,\nWhile you sit warm and read up balanced rations.\nYou can't get too much winter in the winter.'\nThose were his words. And he went home and all\nBut banked the daylight out of Avery's windows.\nNow you and I would go to no such length.\nAt the same time you can't deny it makes\nIt not a mite worse, sitting here, we three,\nPlaying our fancy, to have the snowline run\nSo high across the pane outside. There where\nThere is a sort of tunnel in the frost\nMore like a tunnel than a hole-way down\nAt the far end of it you see a stir\nAnd quiver like the frayed edge of the drift\nBlown in the wind. I like that-I like that.\nWell, now I leave you, people.'\n'Come, Meserve,\nWe thought you were deciding not to go-\nThe ways you found to say the praise of comfort\nAnd being where you are. You want to stay.'\n'I'll own it's cold for such a fall of snow.\nThis house is frozen brittle, all except\nThis room you sit in. If you think the wind\nSounds further off, it's not because it's dying;\nYou're further under in the snow-that's all-\nAnd feel it less. Hear the soft bombs of dust\nIt bursts against us at the chimney mouth,\nAnd at the eaves. I like it from inside\nMore than I shall out in it. But the horses\nAre rested and it's time to say good-night,\nAnd let you get to bed again. Good-night,\nSorry I had to break in on your sleep.'\n'Lucky for you you did. Lucky for you\nYou had us for a half-way station\nTo stop at. If you were the kind of man\nPaid heed to women, you'd take my advice\nAnd for your family's sake stay where you are.\nBut what good is my saying it over and over?\nYou've done more than you had a right to think\nYou could do-now. You know the risk you take\nIn going on.'\n'Our snow-storms as a rule\nAren't looked on as man-killers, and although\nI'd rather be the beast that sleeps the sleep\nUnder it all, his door sealed up and lost,\nThan the man fighting it to keep above it,\nYet think of the small birds at roost and not\nIn nests. Shall I be counted less than they are?\nTheir bulk in water would be frozen rock\nIn no time out to-night. And yet to-morrow\nThey will come budding boughs from tree to tree\nFlirting their wings and saying Chickadee,\nAs if not knowing what you meant by the word storm.'\n'But why when no one wants you to go on?\nYour wife-she doesn't want you to. We don't,\nAnd you yourself don't want to. Who else is there?'\n'Save us from being cornered by a woman.\nWell, there's'-She told Fred afterward that in\nThe pause right there, she thought the dreaded word\nWas coming, 'God.' But no, he only said\n'Well, there's-the storm. That says I must go on.\nThat wants me as a war might if it came.\nAsk any man.'\nHe threw her that as something\nTo last her till he got outside the door.\nHe had Cole with him to the barn to see him off.\nWhen Cole returned he found his wife still standing\nBeside the table near the open book,\nNot reading it.\n'Well, what kind of a man\nDo you call that?' she said.\n'He had the gift\nOf words, or is it tongues, I ought to say?'\n'Was ever such a man for seeing likeness?'\n'Or disregarding people's civil questions-\nWhat? We've found out in one hour more about him\nThan we had seeing him pass by in the road\nA thousand times. If that's the way he preaches!\nYou didn't think you'd keep him after all.\nOh, I'm not blaming you. He didn't leave you\nMuch say in the matter, and I'm just as glad\nWe're not in for a night of him. No sleep\nIf he had stayed. The least thing set him going.\nIt's quiet as an empty church without him.'\n'But how much better off are we as it is?\nWe'll have to sit here till we know he's safe.'\n'Yes, I suppose you'll want to, but I shouldn't.\nHe knows what he can do, or he wouldn't try.\nGet into bed I say, and get some rest.\nHe won't come back, and if he telephones,\nIt won't be for an hour or two.'\n'Well then-\nWe can't be any help by sitting here\nAnd living his fight through with him, I suppose.'\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\nCole had been telephoning in the dark.\nMrs. Cole's voice came from an inner room:\n'Did she call you or you call her?'\n'She me.\nYou'd better dress: you won't go back to bed.\nWe must have been asleep: it's three and after.'\n'Had she been ringing long? I'll get my wrapper.\nI want to speak to her.'\n'All she said was,\nHe hadn't come and had he really started.'\n'She knew he had, poor thing, two hours ago.'\n'He had the shovel. He'll have made a fight.'\n'Why did I ever let him leave this house!'\n'Don't begin that. You did the best you could\nTo keep him-though perhaps you didn't quite\nConceal a wish to see him show the spunk\nTo disobey you. Much his wife'll thank you.'\n'Fred, after all I said! You shan't make out\nThat it was any way but what it was.\nDid she let on by any word she said\nShe didn't thank me?'\n'When I told her 'Gone,'\n'Well then,' she said, and 'Well then'-like a threat.\nAnd then her voice came scraping slow: 'Oh, you,\nWhy did you let him go'?'\n'Asked why we let him?\nYou let me there. I'll ask her why she let him.\nShe didn't dare to speak when he was here.\nTheir number's-twenty-one? The thing won't work.\nSomeone's receiver's down. The handle stumbles.\nThe stubborn thing, the way it jars your arm!\nIt's theirs. She's dropped it from her hand and gone.'\n'Try speaking. Say 'Hello'!'\n'Hello. Hello.'\n'What do you hear?'\n'I hear an empty room-\nYou know-it sounds that way. And yes, I hear-\nI think I hear a clock-and windows rattling.\nNo step though. If she's there she's sitting down.'\n'Shout, she may hear you.'\n'Shouting is no good.'\n'Keep speaking then.'\n'Hello. Hello. Hello.\nYou don't suppose-? She wouldn't go out doors?'\n'I'm half afraid that's just what she might do.'\n'And leave the children?'\n'Wait and call again.\nYou can't hear whether she has left the door\nWide open and the wind's blown out the lamp\nAnd the fire's died and the room's dark and cold?'\n'One of two things, either she's gone to bed\nOr gone out doors.'\n'In which case both are lost.\nDo you know what she's like? Have you ever met her?\nIt's strange she doesn't want to speak to us.'\n'Fred, see if you can hear what I hear. Come.'\n'A clock maybe.'\n'Don't you hear something else?'\n'Not talking.'\n'No.'\n'Why, yes, I hear-what is it?'\n'What do you say it is?'\n'A baby's crying!\nFrantic it sounds, though muffled and far off.'\n'Its mother wouldn't let it cry like that,\nNot if she's there.'\n'What do you make of it?'\n'There's only one thing possible to make,\nThat is, assuming-that she has gone out.\nOf course she hasn't though.' They both sat down\nHelpless. 'There's nothing we can do till morning.'\n'Fred, I shan't let you think of going out.'\n'Hold on.' The double bell began to chirp.\nThey started up. Fred took the telephone.\n'Hello, Meserve. You're there, then!-And your wife?\nGood! Why I asked-she didn't seem to answer.\nHe says she went to let him in the barn.-\nWe're glad. Oh, say no more about it, man.\nDrop in and see us when you're passing.'\n'Well,\nShe has him then, though what she wants him for\nI don't see.'\n'Possibly not for herself.\nMaybe she only wants him for the children.'\n'The whole to-do seems to have been for nothing.\nWhat spoiled our night was to him just his fun.\nWhat did he come in for?-To talk and visit?\nThought he'd just call to tell us it was snowing.\nIf he thinks he is going to make our house\nA halfway coffee house 'twixt town and nowhere- '\n'I thought you'd feel you'd been too much concerned.'\n'You think you haven't been concerned yourself.'\n'If you mean he was inconsiderate\nTo rout us out to think for him at midnight\nAnd then take our advice no more than nothing,\nWhy, I agree with you.

Strange what set you off\nTo come to his house when he's gone to yours.\nYou can't have passed each other. I know what:\nHe must have changed his mind and gone to Garlands.\nHe won't be long in that case. You can wait.\nThough what good you can be, or anyone-\nIt's gone so far. You've heard? Estelle's run off.'\n'Yes, what's it all about? When did she go?'\n'Two weeks since.'\n'She's in earnest, it appears.'\n'I'm sure she won't come back. She's hiding somewhere.\nI don't know where myself. John thinks I do.\nHe thinks I only have to say the word,\nAnd she'll come back. But, bless you, I'm her mother-\nI can't talk to her, and, Lord, if I could!'\n'It will go hard with John. What will he do?\nHe can't find anyone to take her place.'\n'Oh, if you ask me that, what will he do?\nHe gets some sort of bakeshop meals together,\nWith me to sit and tell him everything,\nWhat's wanted and how much and where it is.\nBut when I'm gone- of course I can't stay here:\nEstelle's to take me when she's settled down.\nHe and I only hinder one another.\nI tell them they can't get me through the door, though:\nI've been built in here like a big church organ.\nWe've been here fifteen years.'\n'That's a long time\nTo live together and then pull apart.\nHow do you see him living when you're gone?\nTwo of you out will leave an empty house.'\n'I don't just see him living many years,\nLeft here with nothing but the furniture.\nI hate to think of the old place when we're gone,\nWith the brook going by below the yard,\nAnd no one here but hens blowing about.\nIf he could sell the place, but then, he can't:\nNo one will ever live on it again.\nIt's too run down. This is the last of it.\nWhat I think he will do, is let things smash.\nHe'll sort of swear the time away. He's awful!\nI never saw a man let family troubles\nMake so much difference in his man's affairs.\nHe's just dropped everything. He's like a child.\nI blame his being brought up by his mother.\nHe's got hay down that's been rained on three times.\nHe hoed a little yesterday for me:\nI thought the growing things would do him good.\nSomething went wrong. I saw him throw the hoe\nSky-high with both hands. I can see it now-\nCome here- I'll show you- in that apple tree.\nThat's no way for a man to do at his age:\nHe's fifty-five, you know, if he's a day.'\n'Aren't you afraid of him? What's that gun for?'\n'Oh, that's been there for hawks since chicken-time.\nJohn Hall touch me! Not if he knows his friends.\nI'll say that for him, John's no threatener\nLike some men folk. No one's afraid of him;\nAll is, he's made up his mind not to stand\nWhat he has got to stand.'\n'Where is Estelle?\nCouldn't one talk to her? What does she say?\nYou say you don't know where she is.'\n'Nor want to!\nShe thinks if it was bad to live with him,\nIt must be right to leave him.'\n'Which is wrong!'\n'Yes, but he should have married her.'\n'I know.'\n'The strain's been too much for her all these years:\nI can't explain it any other way.\nIt's different with a man, at least with John:\nHe knows he's kinder than the run of men.\nBetter than married ought to be as good\nAs married- that's what he has always said.\nI know the way he's felt- but all the same!'\n'I wonder why he doesn't marry her\nAnd end it.'\n'Too late now: she wouldn't have him.\nHe's given her time to think of something else.\nThat's his mistake. The dear knows my interest\nHas been to keep the thing from breaking up.\nThis is a good home: I don't ask for better.\nBut when I've said, 'Why shouldn't they be married,'\nHe'd say, 'Why should they?' no more words than that.'\n'And after all why should they? John's been fair\nI take it. What was his was always hers.\nThere was no quarrel about property.'\n'Reason enough, there was no property.\nA friend or two as good as own the farm,\nSuch as it is. It isn't worth the mortgage.'\n'I mean Estelle has always held the purse.'\n'The rights of that are harder to get at.\nI guess Estelle and I have filled the purse.\n'Twas we let him have money, not he us.\nJohn's a bad farmer. I'm not blaming him.\nTake it year in, year out, he doesn't make much.\nWe came here for a home for me, you know,\nEstelle to do the housework for the board\nOf both of us. But look how it turns out:\nShe seems to have the housework, and besides,\nHalf of the outdoor work, though as for that,\nHe'd say she does it more because she likes it.\nYou see our pretty things are all outdoors.\nOur hens and cows and pigs are always better\nThan folks like us have any business with.\nFarmers around twice as well off as we\nHaven't as good. They don't go with the farm.\nOne thing you can't help liking about John,\nHe's fond of nice things- too fond, some would say.\nBut Estelle don't complain: she's like him there.\nShe wants our hens to be the best there are.\nYou never saw this room before a show,\nFull of lank, shivery, half-drowned birds\nIn separate coops, having their plumage done.\nThe smell of the wet feathers in the heat!\nYou spoke of John's not being safe to stay with.\nYou don't know what a gentle lot we are:\nWe wouldn't hurt a hen! You ought to see us\nMoving a flock of hens from place to place.\nWe're not allowed to take them upside down,\nAll we can hold together by the legs.\nTwo at a time's the rule, one on each arm,\nNo matter how far and how many times\nWe have to go.'\n'You mean that's John's idea.'\n'And we live up to it; or I don't know\nWhat childishness he wouldn't give way to.\nHe manages to keep the upper hand\nOn his own farm. He's boss. But as to hens:\nWe fence our flowers in and the hens range.\nNothing's too good for them. We say it pays.\nJohn likes to tell the offers he has had,\nTwenty for this cock, twenty-five for that.\nHe never takes the money. If they're worth\nThat much to sell, they're worth as much to keep.\nBless you, it's all expense, though. Reach me down\nThe little tin box on the cupboard shelf,\nThe upper shelf, the tin box. That's the one.\nI'll show you. Here you are.'\n'What's this?'\n'A bill-\nFor fifty dollars for one Langshang cock-\nReceipted. And the cock is in the yard.'\n'Not in a glass case, then?'\n'He'd need a tall one:\nHe can eat off a barrel from the ground.\nHe's been in a glass case, as you may say,\nThe Crystal Palace, London. He's imported.\nJohn bought him, and we paid the bill with beads-\nWampum, I call it. Mind, we don't complain.\nBut you see, don't you, we take care of him.'\n'And like it, too. It makes it all the worse.'\n'It seems as if. And that's not all: he's helpless\nIn ways that I can hardly tell you of.\nSometimes he gets possessed to keep accounts\nTo see where all the money goes so fast.\nYou know how men will be ridiculous.\nBut it's just fun the way he gets bedeviled-\nIf he's untidy now, what will he be- - ?\n'It makes it all the worse. You must be blind.'\n'Estelle's the one. You needn't talk to me.'\n'Can't you and I get to the root of it?\nWhat's the real trouble? What will satisfy her?'\n'It's as I say: she's turned from him, that's all.'\n'But why, when she's well off? Is it the neighbours,\nBeing cut off from friends?'\n'We have our friends.\nThat isn't it. Folks aren't afraid of us.'\n'She's let it worry her. You stood the strain,\nAnd you're her mother.'\n'But I didn't always.\nI didn't relish it along at first.\nBut I got wonted to it. And besides-\nJohn said I was too old to have grandchildren.\nBut what's the use of talking when it's done?\nShe won't come back- it's worse than that- she can't.'\n'Why do you speak like that? What do you know?\nWhat do you mean?- she's done harm to herself?'\n'I mean she's married- married someone else.'\n'Oho, oho!'\n'You don't believe me.'\n'Yes, I do,\nOnly too well. I knew there must be something!\nSo that was what was back. She's bad, that's all!'\n'Bad to get married when she had the chance?'\n'Nonsense! See what's she done! But who, who- - '\n'Who'd marry her straight out of such a mess?\nSay it right out- no matter for her mother.\nThe man was found. I'd better name no names.\nJohn himself won't imagine who he is.'\n'Then it's all up. I think I'll get away.\nYou'll be expecting John. I pity Estelle;\nI suppose she deserves some pity, too.\nYou ought to have the kitchen to yourself\nTo break it to him. You may have the job.'\n'You needn't think you're going to get away.\nJohn's almost here. I've had my eye on someone\nComing down Ryan's Hill. I thought 'twas him.\nHere he is now. This box! Put it away.\nAnd this bill.'\n'What's the hurry? He'll unhitch.'\n'No, he won't, either. He'll just drop the reins\nAnd turn Doll out to pasture, rig and all.\nShe won't get far before the wheels hang up\nOn something- there's no harm. See, there he is!\nMy, but he looks as if he must have heard!'\nJohn threw the door wide but he didn't enter.\n'How are you, neighbour? Just the man I'm after.\nIsn't it Hell,' he said. 'I want to know.\nCome out here if you want to hear me talk.\nI'll talk to you, old woman, afterward.\nI've got some news that maybe isn't news.\nWhat are they trying to do to me, these two?'\n'Do go along with him and stop his shouting.'\nShe raised her voice against the closing door:\n'Who wants to hear your news, you- dreadful fool?'"},{"author":"Robert Frost","title":"The Egg and the Machine","content":"He gave the solid rail a hateful kick.\nFrom far away there came an answering tick\nAnd then another tick.

He picked one fresh\nIn virgin wrapper from deep in the box,\nAnd stroked it with a horny-handed kindness.\nHe read in one and I read in another,\nBoth either looking for or finding something.\nThe attic wasps went missing by like bullets.\nI was soon satisfied for the time being.\nAll the way home I kept remembering\nThe small book in my pocket. It was there.\nThe poetess had sighed, I knew, in heaven\nAt having eased her heart of one more copy-\nLegitimately. My demand upon her,\nThough slight, was a demand.

You have the answers.\nAnd there was one more not so fair to Paul:\nThat Paul had married a wife not his equal.\nPaul was ashamed of her. To match a hero\nShe would have had to be a heroine;\nInstead of which she was some half-breed squaw.\nBut if the story Murphy told was true,\nShe wasn't anything to be ashamed of.\nYou know Paul could do wonders. Everyone's\nHeard how he thrashed the horses on a load\nThat wouldn't budge, until they simply stretched\nTheir rawhide harness from the load to camp.\nPaul told the boss the load would be all right,\n'The sun will bring your load in'- and it did-\nBy shrinking the rawhide to natural length.\nThat's what is called a stretcher. But I guess\nThe one about his jumping so's to land\nWith both his feet at once against the ceiling,\nAnd then land safely right side up again,\nBack on the floor, is fact or pretty near fact.\nWell, this is such a yarn. Paul sawed his wife\nOut of a white-pine log. Murphy was there\nAnd, as you might say, saw the lady born.\nPaul worked at anything in lumbering.\nHe'd been bard at it taking boards away\nFor- I forget- the last ambitious sawyer\nTo want to find out if he couldn't pile\nThe lumber on Paul till Paul begged for mercy.\nThey'd sliced the first slab off a big butt log,\nAnd the sawyer had slammed the carriage back\nTo slam end-on again against the saw teeth.\nTo judge them by the way they caught themselves\nWhen they saw what had happened to the log,\nThey must have had a guilty expectation\nSomething was going to go with their slambanging.\nSomething bad left a broad black streak of grease\nOn the new wood the whole length of the log\nExcept, perhaps, a foot at either end.\nBut when Paul put his finger in the grease,\nIt wasn't grease at all, but a long slot.\nThe log was hollow. They were sawing pine.\n'First time I ever saw a hollow pine.\nThat comes of having Paul around the place.\nTake it to bell for me,' the sawyer said.\nEveryone had to have a look at it\nAnd tell Paul what he ought to do about it.\n(They treated it as his.) 'You take a jackknife,\nAnd spread the opening, and you've got a dugout\nAll dug to go a-fishing in.' To Paul\nThe hollow looked too sound and clean and empty\nEver to have housed birds or beasts or bees.\nThere was no entrance for them to get in by.\nIt looked to him like some new kind of hollow\nHe thought he'd better take his jackknife to.\nSo after work that evening be came back\nAnd let enough light into it by cutting\nTo see if it was empty. He made out in there\nA slender length of pith, or was it pith?\nIt might have been the skin a snake had cast\nAnd left stood up on end inside the tree\nThe hundred years the tree must have been growing.\nMore cutting and he bad this in both hands,\nAnd looking from it to the pond nearby,\nPaul wondered how it would respond to water.\nNot a breeze stirred, but just the breath of air\nHe made in walking slowly to the beach\nBlew it once off his hands and almost broke it.\nHe laid it at the edge, where it could drink.\nAt the first drink it rustled and grew limp.\nAt the next drink it grew invisible.\nPaul dragged the shallows for it with his fingers,\nAnd thought it must have melted. It was gone.\nAnd then beyond the open water, dim with midges,\nWhere the log drive lay pressed against the boom,\nIt slowly rose a person, rose a girl,\nHer wet hair heavy on her like a helmet,\nWho, leaning on a log, looked back at Paul.\nAnd that made Paul in turn look back\nTo see if it was anyone behind him\nThat she was looking at instead of him.\n(Murphy had been there watching all the time,\nBut from a shed where neither of them could see him.)\nThere was a moment of suspense in birth\nWhen the girl seemed too waterlogged to live,\nBefore she caught her first breath with a gasp\nAnd laughed. Then she climbed slowly to her feet,\nAnd walked off, talking to herself or Paul,\nAcross the logs like backs of alligators,\nPaul taking after her around the pond.\nNext evening Murphy and some other fellows\nGot drunk, and tracked the pair up Catamount,\nFrom the bare top of which there is a view\nTO other hills across a kettle valley.\nAnd there, well after dark, let Murphy tell it,\nThey saw Paul and his creature keeping house.\nIt was the only glimpse that anyone\nHas had of Paul and her since Murphy saw them\nFalling in love across the twilight millpond.\nMore than a mile across the wilderness\nThey sat together halfway up a cliff\nIn a small niche let into it, the girl\nBrightly, as if a star played on the place,\nPaul darkly, like her shadow. All the light\nWas from the girl herself, though, not from a star,\nAs was apparent from what happened next.\nAll those great ruffians put their throats together,\nAnd let out a loud yell, and threw a bottle,\nAs a brute tribute of respect to beauty.\nOf course the bottle fell short by a mile,\nBut the shout reached the girl and put her light out.\nShe went out like a firefly, and that was all.\nSo there were witnesses that Paul was married\nAnd not to anyone to be ashamed of\nEveryone had been wrong in judging Paul.\nMurphy told me Paul put on all those airs\nAbout his wife to keep her to himself.\nPaul was what's called a terrible possessor.\nOwning a wife with him meant owning her.\nShe wasn't anybody else's business,\nEither to praise her or much as name her,\nAnd he'd thank people not to think of her.\nMurphy's idea was that a man like Paul\nWouldn't be spoken to about a wife\nIn any way the world knew how to speak."},{"author":"Robert Frost","title":"Maple","content":"Her teacher's certainty it must be Mabel\nMade Maple first take notice of her name.\nShe asked her father and he told her, 'Maple\u2014\nMaple is right.'\n'But teacher told the school\nThere's no such name.'\n'Teachers don't know as much\nAs fathers about children, you tell teacher.\nYou tell her that it's M-A-P-L-E.\nYou ask her if she knows a maple tree.\nWell, you were named after a maple tree.\nYour mother named you.

They listened for him. Not a rustle!\nI guess they thought I'd spiked him in the temple\nBefore I buried him, else I couldn't have managed.\nThey excavated more. 'Go keep his wife\nOut of the barn.'\nSome one looked in a window;\nAnd curse me, if he wasn't in the kitchen,\nSlumped way down in a chair, with both his feet\nStuck in the oven, the hottest day that summer.\nHe looked so mad in back, and so disgusted\nThere was no one that dared to stir him up\nOr let him know that he was being looked at.\nApparently I hadn't buried him\n(I may have knocked him down), but just my trying\nTo bury him had hurt his dignity.\nHe had gone to the house so's not to face me.\nHe kept away from us all afternoon.\nWe tended to his hay. We saw him out\nAfter a while picking peas in the garden:\nHe couldn't keep away from doing something.\nWeren't you relieved to find he wasn't dead?\nNo!\u2014and yet I can't say: it's hard to tell.\nI went about to kill him fair enough.\nYou took an awkward way.

There's two can play at that.\nI have my fancies: it runs in the family.\nMy father's brother wasn't right. They kept him\nLocked up for years back there at the old farm.\nI've been away once--yes, I've been away.\nThe State Asylum. I was prejudiced;\nI wouldn't have sent anyone of mine there;\nYou know the old idea--the only asylum\nWas the poorhouse, and those who could afford,\nRather than send their folks to such a place,\nKept them at home; and it does seem more human.\nBut it's not so: the place is the asylum.\nThere they have every means proper to do with,\nAnd you aren't darkening other people's lives--\nWorse than no good to them, and they no good\nTo you in your condition; you can't know\nAffection or the want of it in that state.\nI've heard too much of the old-fashioned way.\nMy father's brother, he went mad quite young.\nSome thought he had been bitten by a dog,\nBecause his violence took on the form\nOf carrying his pillow in his teeth;\nBut it's more likely he was crossed in love,\nOr so the story goes. It was some girl.\nAnyway all he talked about was love.\nThey soon saw he would do someone a mischief\nIf he wa'n't kept strict watch of, and it ended\nIn father's building him a sort of cage,\nOr room within a room, of hickory poles,\nLike stanchions in the barn, from floor to ceiling,--\nA narrow passage all the way around.\nAnything they put in for furniture\nHe'd tear to pieces, even a bed to lie on.\nSo they made the place comfortable with straw,\nLike a beast's stall, to ease their consciences.\nOf course they had to feed him without dishes.\nThey tried to keep him clothed, but he paraded\nWith his clothes on his arm--all of his clothes.\nCruel--it sounds. I 'spose they did the best\nThey knew. And just when he was at the height,\nFather and mother married, and mother came,\nA bride, to help take care of such a creature,\nAnd accommodate her young life to his.\nThat was what marrying father meant to her.\nShe had to lie and hear love things made dreadful\nBy his shouts in the night. He'd shout and shout\nUntil the strength was shouted out of him,\nAnd his voice died down slowly from exhaustion.\nHe'd pull his bars apart like bow and bow-string,\nAnd let them go and make them twang until\nHis hands had worn them smooth as any ox-bow.\nAnd then he'd crow as if he thought that child's play--\nThe only fun he had. I've heard them say, though,\nThey found a way to put a stop to it.\nHe was before my time--I never saw him;\nBut the pen stayed exactly as it was\nThere in the upper chamber in the ell,\nA sort of catch-all full of attic clutter.\nI often think of the smooth hickory bars.\nIt got so I would say--you know, half fooling--\n\"It's time I took my turn upstairs in jail\"--\nJust as you will till it becomes a habit.\nNo wonder I was glad to get away.\nMind you, I waited till Len said the word.\nI didn't want the blame if things went wrong.\nI was glad though, no end, when we moved out,\nAnd I looked to be happy, and I was,\nAs I said, for a while--but I don't know!\nSomehow the change wore out like a prescription.\nAnd there's more to it than just window-views\nAnd living by a lake. I'm past such help--\nUnless Len took the notion, which he won't,\nAnd I won't ask him--it's not sure enough.\nI 'spose I've got to go the road I'm going:\nOther folks have to, and why shouldn't I?\nI almost think if I could do like you,\nDrop everything and live out on the ground--\nBut it might be, come night, I shouldn't like it,\nOr a long rain.

My hero, for it will be more inspiring\nIf I set forth a bawdy plot like Byron\nThan if I treat the nation as a whole.\nRadway grew up. These forces shaped his soul;\nThese, and yet God, and Dr. Parkhurst's god, the N.Y. Journal\n(Which pays him more per week than The Supernal).\nThese and another godlet of that day, your day\n(You feed a hen on grease, perhaps she'll lay\nThe sterile egg that is still eatable:\n'Prolific Noyes' with output undefeatable).\nFrom these he (Radway) learnt, from provosts and from editors unyielding\nAnd innocent of Stendhal, Flaubert, Maupassant and Fielding.\nThey set their mind (it's still in that condition)\nMay we repeat; the Centennial Exposition\nAt Philadelphia, 1876?\nWhat it knew then, it knows, and there it sticks.\nAnd yet another, a 'charming man', \u2018sweet nature,' but was Gilder,\nDe mortuis verum, truly the master builder?\nFrom these he learnt. Poe, Whitman, Whistler, men, their recognition\nWas got abroad, what better luck do you wish 'em,\nWhen writing well has not yet been forgiven\nIn Boston, to Henry James, the greatest whom we've seen living.\nAnd timorous love of the innocuous\nBrought from Gt. Britain and dumped down a'top of us,\nTill you may take your choice: to feel the edge of satire or\nRead Bennett or some other flaccid flatterer.\nDespite it all, despite your Red Bloods, febrile concupiscence\nWhose blubbering yowls you take for passion's essence;\nDespite it all, your compound predilection\nFor ignorance, its growth and its protection\n(Vide the tariff), I will hang simple facts\nUpon a tale, to combat other tracts,\n'Message to Garcia,' Mosher's propagandas\nThat are the nation's botts, collicks and glanders.\nOr from the feats of Sumner cull it? Think,\nCould Freud or Jung'unfathom such a sink?\nMy hero, Radway, I have named, in truth,\nSome forces among those which 'formed' his youth:\nThese heavy weights, these dodgers and these preachers,\nCrusaders, lecturers and secret lechers,\nWho wrought about his 'soul' their stale infection.\nThese are the high-brows, and to this collection\nThe social itch, the almost, all but, not quite, fascinating,\nPiquante, delicious, luscious, captivating:\nPuffed satin, and silk stockings, where the knee\nClings to the skirt in strict (vide: 'Vogue') propriety.\nThree thousand chorus girls and all unkissed,\nstate sans song, sans home-grown wine, sans realist!\n'Tell me not in mournful wish-wash\nLife's a sort of sugared dish-wash!'\nRadway had read the various evening papers\nAnd yearned to imitate the Waldorf capers\nAs held before him in that unsullied mirror\nThe daily press, and monthlies nine cents dearer.\nThey held the very marrow of the ideals\nThat fed his spirit; were his mental meals.\nAlso, he'd read of Christian virtues in\nThat canting rag called Everybody's Magazine,\nAnd heard a clergy that tries on more wheezes\nThan e'er were heard of by Our Lord Ch . . . . J\nSo he 'faced life' with rather mixed intentions,\nHe had attended country Christian Endeavour Conventions,\nWhere one gets more chances\nThan Spanish ladies had in old romances.\n(Let him rebuke who ne'er has known the pure Platonic grapple,\nOr hugged two girls at once behind a chapel.)\nSuch practices diluted rural boredom\nThough some approved of them, and some deplored 'em.\nSuch was he when he got his mother's letter\nAnd would not think a thing that could upset her. . . .\nYet saw an ad.' To-night, THE HUDSON SAIL,\nWith forty queens, and music to regale\nThe select company: beauties you all would know\nBy name, if named.' So it was phrased, or rather somewhat so\nI have mislaid the \u2018ad.', but note the touch,\nNote, reader, note the sentimental touch:\nHis mother's birthday gift. (How pitiful\nThat only sentimental stuff will sell!)\nYet Radway went. A circumspectious prig!\nAnd then that woman like a guinea-pig\nAccosted, that's the word, accosted him,\nThereon the amorous calor slightly frosted him.\n(I burn, I freeze, I sweat, said the fair Greek,\nI speak in contradictions, so to speak.)\nI've told his training, he was never bashful,\nAnd his pockets by ma's aid, that night with cash full,\nThe invitation had no need of fine aesthetic,\nNor did disgust prove such a strong emetic\nThat we, with Masefield's vein, in the next sentence\nRecord \u2018Odd's blood! Ouch! Ouch!' a prayer, his swift repentance.\nNo, no, they danced. The music grew much louder\nAs he inhaled the 'still fumes of rice-powder.\nThen there came other nights, came slow but certain\nAnd were such nights that we should 'draw the curtain'\nIn writing fiction on uncertain chances\nOf publication; 'Circumstances,'\nAs the editor of The Century says in print,\n'Compel a certain silence and restraint.'\nStill we will bring our 'fiction as near to fact' as\nThe Sunday school brings virtues into practice.\nSoon our hero could manage once a week,\nNot that his pay had risen, and no leak\nWas found in his employer's cash. He learned the lay of cheaper places,\nAnd then Radway began to go the paces:\nA rosy path, a sort of vernal ingress,\nAnd Truth should here be careful of her thin dress\nThough males of seventy, who fear truths naked harm us,\nMust think Truth looks as they do in wool pyjamas.\n(My country, I've said your morals and your thoughts are stale ones,\nBut surely the worst of your old-women are the male ones.)\nWhy paint these days? An insurance inspector\nFor fires and odd risks, could in this sector\nFurnish more data for a compilation\nThan I can from this distant land and station,\nUnless perhaps I should have recourse to\nOne of those firm-faced inspecting women, who\nFind pretty Irish girls in Chinese laundries,\nUp stairs, the third floor up, and have such quandaries\nAs to how and why and whereby they got in\nAnd for what earthly reason they remain. . . .\nAlas, eheu, one question that sorely vexes\nThe serious social folk is \u2018just what sex is'.\nThough it will, of course, pass off with social science\nIn which their mentors place such wide reliance . .\nDe Gourmont says that fifty grunts are all that will be prized.\nOf langauge, by men wholly socialized,\nWith signs as many, that shall represent 'em\nWhen thoroughly socialized printers want to print 'em.\n\u2018As free of mobs as kings'? I'd have men free of that invidious,\nLurking, serpentine, amphibious and insidious\nPower that compels 'em\nTo be so much alike that every dog that smells 'em,\nThinks one identity is\nSmeared o'er the lot in equal quantities.\nStill we look toward the day when man, with unction,\nWill long only to be a social function,\nAnd even Zeus' wild lightning fear to strike\nLest it should fail to treat all men alike.\nAnd I can hear an old man saying: \u2018Oh, the rub!\u2019\nI see them sitting in the Harvard Club,\n'And rate 'em up at just so much per head,\n'Till I have viewed straw hats and their habitual clothing\n'All the same style, same cut, with perfect loathing.'\nSo Radway walked, quite like the other men,\nOut into the crepuscular half-light, now and then;\nSaw what the city offered, cast an eye\nUpon Manhattan's gorgeous panoply,\nThe flood of limbs upon Eighth Avenue\nTo beat Prague, Budapesth, Vienna or Moscow,\nSuch animal invigorating carriage\nAs nothing can restrain or much disparage. . . .\nStill he was not given up to brute enjoyment,\nAn anxious sentiment was his employment,\nFor memory of the first warm night still cast a haze o'er\nThe mind of Radway, whene'er he found a pair of purple stays or\nSome other quaint reminder of the occasion\nThat first made him believe in immoral suasion.\nA temperate man, a thin potationist, each day\nA silent hunter off the Great White Way,\nHe read The Century and thought it nice\nTo be not too well known in haunts of vice\nThe prominent haunts, where one might recognize him,\nAnd in his daily walks duly capsize him.\nThus he eschewed the bright red-walled cafes and\nWas never one of whom one speaks as \u2018brazen'd'.\nSome men will live as prudes in their own village\nAnd make the tour abroad for their wild tillage\nI knew a tourist agent, one whose art is\nTo run such tours. He calls 'em. . . . house parties.\nBut Radway was a patriot whose venality\nWas purer in its love of one locality,\nA home-industrious worker to perfection,\nA sensational jobber for protection,\nEspecially on books, lest knowledge break in\nUpon the national brains and set 'em achin'.\n'Tis an anomaly in our large land of freedom,\nYou can not get cheap books, even if you need 'em.)\nRadway was ignorant as an editor,\nAnd, heavenly, holy gods! I can't say more,\nThough I know one, a very base detractor,\nWho has the phrase \u2018As ignorant as an actor,'\nBut turn to Radway: the first night on the river,\nRunning so close to \u2018hell\u2019 it sends a shiver\nDown Rodyheaver's prophylactic spine,\nLet me return to this bold theme of mine,\nOf Radway. O clap hand ye moralists!\nAnd meditate upon the Lord's conquests.\nWhen last I met him, he was a pillar in\nAn organization for the suppression of sin. . . .\nNot that he'd changed his tastes, nor yet his habits,\n(Such changes don't occur in men, or rabbits).\nNot that he was a saint, nor was top-loftical\nIn spiritual aspirations, but he found it profitable,\nFor as Ben Franklin said, with such urbanity:\n'Nothing will pay thee, friend, like Christianity.'\nAnd in our day thus saith the Evangelist:\n'Tent preachin' is the kind that pays the best.'\n'Twas as a business asset pure an\u2019 simple\nThat Radway joined the Baptist Broadway Temple.\nI find no moral for a peroration,\nHe is the prototype of half the nation."},{"author":"Ezra Pound","title":"Yeux

Ten-Shin.\nWith yellow gold and white jewels, we paid for songs\nand laughter\nAnd we were drunk for month on month, forgetting the\nkings and princes.\nIntelligent men came drifting in from the sea and from\nthe west border,\nAnd with them, and with you especially\nThere was nothing at cross purpose,\nAnd they made nothing of sea-crossing or of mountain-\ncrossing,\nIf only they could be of that fellowship,\nAnd we all spoke out our hearts and minds, and without\nregret.\nAnd when I was sent off to South Wei,\nsmothered in laurel groves,\nAnd you to the north of Raku-hoku,\nTill we had nothing but thoughts and memories in\ncommon.\nAnd then, when separation had come to its worst,\nWe met, and travelled into Sen-Go,\nThrough all the thirty-six folds of the turning and\ntwisting waters,\nInto a valley of the thousand bright flowers,\nThat was the first valley;\nAnd into ten thousand valleys full of voices and pine-\nwinds.\nAnd with silver harness and reins of gold,\nOut came the East of Kan foreman and his company.\nAnd there came also the \u2018True man\u2019 of Shi-yo to meet\nme,\nPlaying on a jewelled mouth-organ.\nIn the storied houses of San-Ko they gave us more\nSennin music,\nMany instruments, like the sound of young phoenix\nbroods.\nThe foreman of Kan Chu, drunk, danced\nbecause his long sleeves wouldn't keep still\nWith that music playing,\nAnd I, wrapped in brocade, went to sleep with my\nhead on his lap,\nAnd my spirit so high it was all over the heavens,\nAnd before the end of the day we were scattered like\nstars, or rain.\nI had to be off to So, far away over the waters,\nYou back to your river-bridge.\nAnd your father, who was brave as a leopard,\nWas governor in Hei Shu, and put down the barbarian\nrabble.\nAnd one May he had you send for me,\ndespite the long distance.\nAnd what with broken wheels and so on, I won't say it\nwasn't hard going,\nOver roads twisted like sheep's guts.\nAnd I was still going, late in the year,\nin the cutting wind from the North,\nAnd thinking how little you cared for the cost,\nand you caring enough to pay it.\nAnd what a reception:\nRed jade cups, food well set on a blue jewelled table,\nAnd I was drunk, and had no thought of returning.\nAnd you would walk out with me to the western corner\nof the castle,\nTo the dynastic temple, with water about it clear as\nblue jade,\nWith boats floating, and the sound of mouth-organs and\ndrums,\nWith ripples like dragon-scales, going grass green on the\nwater,\nPleasure lasting, with courtezans, going and coming\nwithout hindrance,\nWith the willow flakes falling like snow,\nAnd the vermilioned girls getting drunk about sunset,\nAnd the water, a hundred feet deep, reflecting green\neyebrows\nEyebrows painted green are a fine sight in young\nmoonlight,\nGracefully painted\nAnd the girls singing back at each other,\nDancing in transparent brocade,\nAnd the wind lifting the song, and interrupting it,\nTossing it up under the clouds.\nAnd all this comes to an end.\nAnd is not again to be met with.\nI went up to the court for examination,\nTried Layu's luck, offered the Choyo song,\nAnd got no promotion,\nand went back to the East Mountains\nWhite-headed.\nAnd once again, later, we met at the South bridge-head.\nAnd then the crowd broke up, you went north to San\npalace,\nAnd if you ask how I regret that parting:\nIt is like the flowers falling at Spring's end\nConfused, whirled in a tangle.\nWhat is the use of talking, and there is no end of talking,\nThere is no end of things in the heart.\nI call in the

dress,\nLips shrunk back for the wind's caress\nAs lips shrink back when we feel the strain\nOf love that loveth in hell's disdeign,\nAnd sense the teeth through the lips that press\n'Gainst our lips for the soul's distress\nThat striveth to ours across the pain.\nDrink we skoal to the gallows tree!\nFrancois and Margot and thee and me,\nFor Jehan and Raoul de Vallerie\nWhose frames have the night and its winds in fee.\nMaturin, Guillaume, Jacques d'Allmain,\nCuldou lacking a coat to bless\nOne lean moiety of his nakedness\nThat plundered St. Hubert back o' the fane:\nAie! the lean bare tree is widowed again\nFor Michault le Borgne that would confess\nIn 'faith and troth' to a traitoress,\n'Which of his brothers had he slain?'\nBut drink we skoal to the gallows tree!\nFrancois and Margot and thee and me:\nThese that we loved shall God love less\nAnd smite always at their faibleness?\nSkoal!! to the gallows! and then pray we:\nGod damn his hell out speedily\nAnd bring their souls to his
